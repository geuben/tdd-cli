## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

Initial release.

- Ledger-backed TDD process controller: phase is derived from observed test
  execution, never asserted by the caller.
- Plan contracts in YAML front-matter, hashed at the committed blob.
- Standard, pin, and contract cycle kinds.
- pytest and vitest adapters.
- Phase-derived staging and committing; artifact regeneration in separate commits.
- Machine-wide worker leases so concurrent agents share cores.
- `tdd fleet`: read-only view of every agent's run on a repository.
- Fidelity metrics, typed blockers, friction-log rendering.
